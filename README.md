# Overview
Terrorism is a form of violence that seeks to achieve political, ideological, or religious goals through the use of fear, intimidation, and violence. It is a global problem that affects people from all walks of life and all parts of the world. While acts of terrorism have been committed throughout history, the term "terrorism" has become more widely used since the 1970s to describe a specific type of violent activity.

However, most definitions of terrorism include the use of violence or the threat of violence against non-combatant targets for political or ideological purposes. The impact of terrorism can be devastating. It can result in loss of life, physical and emotional trauma, economic disruption, and political instability.

Addressing terrorism requires a multifaceted approach that includes law enforcement, intelligence gathering, diplomacy, and education. In conclusion, terrorism is a complex and challenging problem that requires a multifaceted approach to address and one of them is by analysing the data of past terrorist attacks which can help the agencies in taking knowledgeble and precautious actions.
